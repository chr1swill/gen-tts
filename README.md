# Convert A Text File Into A Wav File With High Quality TTS

This program accept two input. The first is the filepath to the file containing the words you would like to have spoken. The second is the the filepath to the where you would like the .wav output to be writen

## Dependancy

To use this you must have these installed on you system:
- python3
- pip

## Getting Started

To get start you first must install the requrired packages on your system using pip. I recommend using a virutal env but if you want to give python packages root access that is up to you.

### Setting up Virtual Environment 

Run thses commands:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing requried packages

Run this command:
```bash
pip install chatterbox-tts
```

### Usage

Run this command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

It will tell you everything you need to know.

## Note

This has only been tested on Ubuntu 24. If you find it doesn't work on your OS I'm sorry :(
